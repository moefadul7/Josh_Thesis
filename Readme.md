## Summary:

### Abstract:
- *Goal of study*: "improving the reliability of High-voltage electrical transmission ..."
	
	- <span style="color:red"> Are you directly improving the reliability of high-voltage transmission itself, or is it the corresponding data collection process you are talking about here? Does data compression on edge positively impact the reliability of high-voltage transmission ? I think the language is a littile confusing</span>


### Chapter I:

- **Intro page 2**: "Each of these automation systems aims to either monitor and control ..." 

	- <span style:"color:red"> The sentence should be 'either ... or'</span>

- **Intro page 4**: "Two such problems include the (i) computational requirement and "

	- <span style:"color:red"> You are claiming that the computational requirement is a challenge for SEI, how did you measure that? We can get over 99% accuracy with a SVM or 3-layer model. I think a better way to discribe the first challenge is through scalability rather than computational requirement </span>

- **Intro page 5**: "this approach report only the target domain accuracy, which is included in the training set ..."

	- <span style:"color:red"> why do we need a third collection for target domain evaluation ? can't we just do a train/test split for the second collection to blindly test the target ?</span>
